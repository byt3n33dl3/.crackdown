	 * after a programmable delay using the on-chip PA bias DAC. The slow-

	 * Tx-to-Rx turnaround time.

	 * All Rx circuit blocks are powered on and active. Antenna signal is
	 * applied; RF is downconverted, filtered, and buffered at Rx BB I and Q
	 * outputs. The slow- charging Tx circuits are in a precharged “idle-off”
	 * state for fast Rx-to-Tx turnaround time.
